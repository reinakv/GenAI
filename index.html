    <h1 class="music">
      This music is AI-generated… Yeah, Johnny Cash never actually sang 'Barbie Girl.' Bummer.
    </h1>
    <h2 class="heading">
      What does AI-generated music mean? To understand where we are today, let's travel back in time a bit....
    </h2>
    <h2 class="monastery-title">
      11th to 14th century
    </h2>
    <p class="monastery-info">
      Music was primarily preserved in monasteries and cathedrals, with limited distribution. People who wished to enjoy music often visited these establishments to listen and partake. Manuscript collections, such as the Chantilly Codex and the Montpellier Codex, preserved a wealth of secular and sacred music from this period.
    </p>
    <h2 class="printer-title">
      15th century
    </h2>
    <p class="printer-info">
      Johannes Gutenberg invented the very first printer. This invention revolutionized nearly every aspect of human life. In the context of music, people were able to share music sheets and ideas for composition for the first time.
    </p> 
    <h2 class="piano-title">
      16th-17th Century
    </h2>
    <p class="piano-info">
      The Renaissance period, characterized by a revival of interest in classical art, literature, and learning, as well as a shift towards humanism, individualism, and scientific inquiry. Music printing flourished during this era, with the publication of choral collections, instrumental treatises, and theoretical works by prominent composers and music theorists.
    </p>
    <h2 class="opera-title">
      18th-19th Century
    </h2>
    <p class="opera-info">
      During the Enlightenment era, paralleling the Industrial Revolution, music became more about expression and emotions. Music transitioned from being a rarity to a luxury with the introduction of opera halls and public concerts. These venues provided dedicated spaces for the performance and dissemination of music to wider audiences, democratizing access to music and culture.
    </p> 
    <h2 class="radio-title">
      20th Century
    </h2>
    <p class="radio-info">
      The Digital Revolution once again took the world by storm, making music something that could be enjoyed in one's own space without any restrictions. The incorporation of music into film and television productions became increasingly important, influencing popular culture and broadening the audience for various musical genres.
    </p> 
    <h2 class="now-title">
      Now
    </h2>
    <p class="now-info">
      Streaming platforms have become the dominant mode of music consumption, with users accessing vast libraries of music on-demand through subscription services or ad-supported platforms.
    </p> 
    <p class="lecture1">
      We transitioned from a time when music was seldom heard and viewed as something to be conserved, to an era where it's uncommon not to engage with music in some capacity every single day. We are currently at the heart of another technological revolution, where many manual jobs that once seemed necessary will be deemed obsolete. These shifts, whether driven by changing ideologies or advancements in technology, often render once-vital manual jobs obsolete.  New jobs and skills will replace the current needs 
    </p>
    <p class="lecture2">
      Throughout history, such changes have prompted humans to adapt and evolve, striving for greater efficiency and quality in the way we live.
    </p>
    <p class="lecture3">
      With the advent of each new era, concerns have often arisen regarding the potential scarcity of employment opportunities. Yet history attests otherwise. With each passing era, transformations catalyze industries with fresh ideas and innovations, invariably leading to expansion and improvement.
    </p>
    <p class="lecture4">
      Despite the apparent sudden ubiquity of AI, its technological roots trace back to the 1950s. The recent surge in new applications and advancements represents the culmination of decades of dedicated research and development.
    </p>
    <p class="lecture5">
      So, to what extent does AI play a role in the creation of music? Can it create its own music? How is it creating new music never heard before? Are musicians completely irrelevant now? What is the role of AI at this point in time?
    </p>
    <p class="explain1">
      To understand these questions, we need to first understand how AI works. Artificial Intelligence requires a LOT of data points. Different kinds of data give the machine as much of a range as possible.
    </p>
    <p class="explain2">
      What AI does is not take bits and pieces of already existing music to create new music like puzzle pieces. Creating a Frankensteinian music that may or may not have coherence.
    </p>
    <p class="explain3">
      But that is not what is happening. It uses a few songs as a base to be “inspired” from to create a whole new piece of music.
    </p>
    <p class="question1">
      WAIT
    </p>
    <p class="question2">
      So, does this mean AI can create new things?
    </p>
    <p class="question3">
      Can AI invent and innovate?
    </p>
    <p class="question4">
      Does it have the ability to creatively think?
    </p>
    <p class="question5">
      Is it going to take over the world? 
    </p>
    <p class="question6">
      Is AI going to become our overlords?
    </p>
    <p class="question7">
      Are we headed towards a world where humans are obsolete?
    </p>
    <p class="inspire1">
      Nope
    </p>
    <p class="inspire2">
      As mentioned before, AI requires a lot of data, an algorithm that feeds on our data to create things. In the case of music, AI would not be able to create new music if it did not have thousands if not millions of music data to train off of.
    </p>
    <p class="inspire3">
      Where does this data come from?
    </p>
    <p class="inspire4">
      YOU
    </p>
    <p class="inspire5">
      With every little thing you create, you are creating a data point for the AI. Your creations fuel the technology. If humans were to stop creating today, soon enough, the technology will stagnate. The art of creation and the ability to think creatively are so intricately human that AI cannot replicate it.
    </p>
    <p class="inspire6">
      A single idea can spawn into several more. AI can be a tool that facilitates that human skill and essentially gives it a boost. A small artist from Warsaw, Poland, could collaborate with another beginner artist in Mangalore, India with the correct use of this technology.
    </p>
    <p class="inspire7">
      When everything is said and done, this is just a tool. The nearly divine power to create and innovate is something that resides within you.
    </p>
    <p class="final">
      So. Just. Create.
